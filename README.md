# Jandon Shurell Capstone Project - Recipe Planner App

## Description
A web and mobile application designed to help users manage grocery lists and find, share, and plan meals. 

## Tech Stack 
Our Recipe Planner app utilizes Ionic, React, and Firebase frameworks.

### Why We Chose Ionic and React
We chose Ionic and React for our Recipe Planner app to take advantage of cross-platform development, enabling us to maintain a single codebase for Android, iOS, and web applications. Both frameworks offer extensive community support and detailed documentation, making it easier to find solutions and resources. By leveraging familiar web technologies through Ionic and benefiting from React's performance and component-based architecture, our development process becomes faster and more efficient. This approach allows our team to focus on delivering a high-quality user experience across all platforms.

### Why We Chose Firebase
We are also utilizing firebase for its backend services, including database management, authentication, cloud storage, and hosting. Using firebase allows our team to simplify the backend infastructure so we can focus more on improving our app, while firebase synchronizes data across all devices. 

### Testing Frameworks
For testing, we use Cypress for end-to-end testing and Vitest for unit testing. Cypress allows us to simulate user interactions and verify our app works as it should from the user's perspective. Vitest is useful for isolating functions and components, ensuring correct functionality. Using these frameworks allows our team to catch errors early and maintain code quality and consistentency.
