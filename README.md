# Jandon Shurell Capstone Project - Recipe Planner App

## Description
A web and mobile application designed to help users manage grocery lists and find, share, and plan meals. 

## Tech Stack 
Our Recipe Planner app utilizes Ionic and React frameworks.

### Why We Chose Ionic and React
We chose Ionic and React for our Recipe Planner app to take advantage of cross-platform development, enabling us to maintain a single codebase for Android, iOS, and web applications. Both frameworks offer extensive community support and detailed documentation, making it easier to find solutions and resources. By leveraging familiar web technologies through Ionic and benefiting from React's performance and component-based architecture, our development process becomes faster and more efficient. This approach allows our team to focus on delivering a high-quality user experience across all platforms.
